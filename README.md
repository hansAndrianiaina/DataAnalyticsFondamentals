## 📘 Module 1: What is Data Analytics?

**Definition:**

Data analytics is the process of examining raw data to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, and support decision-making.

**Types of Data Analytics:**

| Type             | Description          | Example                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Descriptive**  | What happened?       | Monthly report (sales, performance activities, ...)             |
| **Diagnostic**   | Why did it happen?   | Performances analysis (e.g : sales, ...)              |
| **Predictive**   | What will happen?    | Forecasting, simulation : future sales, business rules changes, budget allocation        |

```

Start with small projects, gradually increase complexity, and showcase your work on platforms like GitHub or LinkedIn.

You can use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks to start with your projects, share insights, and visualize data. The basic stack of Python with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn is a great starting point for data analysis, along with SQL for data querying.

Then after you feel comfortable, you can explore more advanced tools like Tableau or Power BI for visualization, and build automated dashboards.
