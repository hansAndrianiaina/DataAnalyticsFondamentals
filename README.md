## 🔁 Suggested Learning Path

```text
1. Understand Concepts → 2. Learn Tools → 3. Practice Projects → 4. Build Portfolio → 5. Apply for Jobs
```

Start with small projects, gradually increase complexity, and showcase your work on platforms like GitHub or LinkedIn.

You can use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks to start with your projects, share insights, and visualize data. The basic stack of Python with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn is a great starting point for data analysis, along with SQL for data querying.

Then after you feel comfortable, you can explore more advanced tools like Tableau or Power BI for visualization, and build automated dashboards.
